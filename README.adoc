Thank you so much @lome for providing this awesome library: https://github.com/lome/niceqr

I adopted the code, but ported it to Kotlin and tried to condense the code to what's really necessary.
I also added a few more options to the QR code generation... 👨‍💻️

== Creating QR Codes with Kotlin or Java

You can use the `QrCodeCreator` to create a QR code as `BufferedImage`, which you can configure and use for further image processing.
