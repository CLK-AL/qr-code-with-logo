Thank you so much @lome for providing this awesome library: https://github.com/lome/niceqr

I adopted the code, but ported it to Kotlin and tried to condense the code to what's really necessary.
I also added a few more options to the QR code generation... üë®‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è

== Creating QR Codes with Kotlin or Java

The entry point is the `QrCodeFactory`,
which will give you an instance of the `QrCodeApi` to create a QR code as `BufferedImage`.
This `BufferedImage` can be configured by passing an instance of `QrCodeConfig` and use for further image processing.

Examples for Java or Kotlin can be found in the `java-sample` or `kotlin-sample` module.

== Logo scaling

Scaling down the logo image in advance will improve the image quality of the logo.

But compare yourself:

Logo with 500x500px (Qr Code size=300px):

image::./docs/qr-with-logo-unscaled.png[]

Logo with 60x60px (Qr Code size=300px):

image::./docs/qr-with-logo-scaled.png[]

NOTE: I chose 60x60px, because the default logo relative size is 0.2, which means 20% of the QR code size, which is 60x60px when having a 300x300px qr code (300*0.2=60).

The reason for this is the fact that the scaling capabilities of awt are *not* that good.

So you should either scale the logo manually or use the following beforehand:

- java.awt.Image.getScaledInstance(int width, int height, int hints)

== Example QR codes

=== Shapes

Using the defaults only:

Adding a center logo:

Adding a border:

Adding radius to positional squares:

image::./docs/qr-with-logo-and-border-and-p-border-round.png[]

Having circles as positional "squares":

=== Colors

Add some decent red color:

Make it look like a Minecraft Creeper QR code:

image::./docs/minecraft-creeper-color.png[]

To see what's possible with colors, have a look at the rainbow example in the bad examples below.

== Bad examples

Not having enough contrast:

The rainbow QR code to depict what's possible:

image::./docs/rainbow-color.png[]

These are bad examples, because the colors are not contrasting enough.

So please be cautious when changing the colors!
*Not* having enough contrast may cause that qr code scanners are not capable to read the qr code!
If you try to scan the bad exmaple qr codes from above, you will see that it's not working.
