Thank you so much @lome for providing this awesome library: https://github.com/lome/niceqr

I adopted the code, but ported it to Kotlin and tried to condense the code to what's really necessary.
I also added a few more options to the QR code generation... üë®‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è

== Creating QR Codes with Kotlin or Java

The entry point is the `QrCodeFactory`,
which will give you an instance of the `QrCodeApi` to create a QR code as `BufferedImage`.
This `BufferedImage` can be configured by passing an instance of `QrCodeConfig` and use for further image processing.

Examples for Java or Kotlin can be found in the `java-sample` or `kotlin-sample` module.

== Example QR codes

Using the defaults only:

Adding a center logo:

Having circles as positional "squares":

Make it "colorful":
